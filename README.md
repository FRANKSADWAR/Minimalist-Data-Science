# Minimalist Data Science

This is a collection of machine learning projects and feature engineering projects and concepts. Having worked on them, they can be a great start point 
for concepts in Machine Learning and data science.


## Data Science Life Cycle
Data science involves asking questions, obtaining the data understanding the data and understanding the real world or the problem's context. The combinations of methods and techniques from statistics and CS
enables us to draw insights from data and nterpret the data in the context of the problem being solved.

The data science life cycle involves: 

1. Asking the questions
2. Obtaining the data
3. Understanding the data
4. Understanding the world
